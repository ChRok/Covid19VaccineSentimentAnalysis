# Covid19VaccineSentimentAnalysis

In the code.ipynb file we are trying to get a Sentiment Analysis for tweets that refer to the Covid19 Vaccine. For data we use the covidvaccine.csv file downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/kaushiksuresh147/covidvaccine-tweets. By the time the project is uploaded covidvaccine.csv file contains tweets in english language starting from October - 2020 till January - 2022. This data set brings the twitter tweets made with the hashtag #CovidVaccine.
