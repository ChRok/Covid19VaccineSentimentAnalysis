# Covid19VaccineSentimentAnalysis

In the code.ipynb file we are trying to get a Sentiment Analysis for tweets that refer to the Covid19 Vaccine. Because we wanted to get history data since the beginning of the pandemic and tweepy api gives us data only for the last 7 days, as inout data we decided to use the covidvaccine.csv file (https://www.kaggle.com/kaushiksuresh147/covidvaccine-tweets). By the time the project is uploaded the file contains tweets in english language starting from October - 2020 till January - 2022. This data set brings the twitter tweets made with the hashtag #CovidVaccine.
